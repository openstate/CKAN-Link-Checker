    "notes": "\nThis table presents the water accounts, being part of the environmental accounts compiled by Statistics Netherlands annually. This Water Accounting table includes the (physical) water use by the Dutch economic activities. A distinction is made between the use of tap water (of drinking water quality), use and abstraction (withdrawal) of groundwater and of surface water. The water used is allocated to the industries and households. Alternatively, tables selections can be made that show break down by economic activity (including households), by water type and annual use. Data in the environmental accounts directly correspond to the economic data in the national accounts, that allow assessment of the impact of the economic performance of the Netherlands for the use of water taken from the natural environment in quantitative terms. From the water accounts bills, environmental indicators can be derived. As an example the water use intensity for the different types can be determined for the Netherlands as a whole or for the break down by industry.\n\nData available from: 2003\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe data for the last year in this table are provisional. Figures for the other years are final, with the exception of tap water. For tap water the whole time series are provisional.\nThe entire time series from 2003 onwards, if necessary, is to be adjusted annually to reflect the updated source information.\n\nChanges as of November 18, 2014:\nNew table.\nThe water use figures in manufacturing are adapted and improved as for some industries the coverage of the data is extended by adding extra companies. In addition figures are corrected for the use of industry water; that consists of tap water with different quality than drinking water. This influences the tap water figures for the chemical manufacturing, metal manufacturing, for refineries and for electricity producers. Finally, the figures are slightly modified due to adjusted weighting between (manufacturing) industry and services.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew figures will be published by November, together with the appearance of the publication \u2018Environmental Accounts of the Netherlands\u2019.\n",
