    "notes": "\nThis table contains key figures from the environmental accounts and the National Accounts. It shows contributions to various environmental issues such as global warming, acidification, environmental costs and environmental taxes by industries. In addition, some economic characteristics of the National accounts are included for comparison, e.g. gross value added and the number of employee jobs converted to full-time equivalents.\nThe environmental accounts are consistent with the concepts and definitions of the National Accounts. This implies that, for physical material flows, the direct relationship with the Dutch economy is the focal point. Material flows are attributed to the economic activities where the actions actually take place, they are registered according to the residence principle. This means that all air pollution caused by Dutch transport companies is taken into account for the Netherlands, but that air pollution caused by transport companies from abroad within the Dutch territory is not.\nThe environmental accounts are based on figures from the environmental statistics. These data are based on the territory principle, however, everything that happens within the Dutch territory. Because of the consistency between the environmental accounts and the National Accounts, Dutch environmental indicators can be compared directly to the main economic indicators. Due to the difference in approach between environmental accounts and environmental statistics, results may vary somewhat.\n\nData available from: 2001\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThis table contains figures from various sources. For figures related to the National Accounts: most recent reference period has status Provisional, whereas the reference period prior to that has the status Revised Provisional. After two years the data become Definite. Data for 2001-2010 are still regarded as Provisional, as the Dutch National Accounts are currently being revised to comply with the European System of National and Regional Accounts 2010 (ESR 2010). Data based on the environmental accounts will be revised over a longer period of time, because of adjustments in the data sources used. This to maintain the closest relation possible to the environmental statistics.\n\nChanges as of 9 January 2015:\nNone, this is a new table. In 2014, Dutch National Accounts have been revised comprehensively. This table contains results after revision.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nUpdated once a year, as a rule in November (at the same time as the update of the environmental accounts).\n",
