    "notes": "\nThis table contains figures on the emissions in the Netherlands by stationary and mobile sources, calculated according to the NEC-directive (NEC = national emission ceilings). This directive has been drawn up in 2001 by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to set upper limits for the total emissions of SO2, NOx, NH3 and non-methane VOCs by each member state.\nThe calculation of emissions by stationary sources is, among other data sources, based on specifications in the annual emission reports of separate enterprises and additional estimates based on production and energy data provided by Statistics Netherlands. \nEmissions by mobile sources are calculated by multiplying data on activities, for instance vehicle kilometres and fuel consumption, by emission factors.\n\nData available from: 1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nIn order to obtain a consistent time series the complete data set is (re)calculated when necessary, so as to be able to include the latest insights in the survey, especially in the case of emission factors.\n\nChanges as of 9 March 2015:\n\nAll sources:\n- Replacement of 2013 provisional figures by definite figures. \n\nStationary Sources:\n- The NOx emissions from agriculture are substantially lower than in the previous versions of this table. These emissions are now reported according to international guidelines. \n- The NH3 emissions from agriculture have been calculated with higher shed factors for several animal species. \n- There are changes in the emissions of private households, mainly due the use of new data for wood use in fireplaces.\n\nMobile sources:\n- The motorcycle and moped emissions of 1990-2012 have been recalculated with improved emission factors. Based on a new  survey, mopeds of recent model years  in particular appear to be more polluting than assumed at first. \n- There has been an update of emission factors for road traffic. This particularly concerns CNG vehicles, EURO 4, 5 and 6 diesel cars, EURO 5 plug-in hybrids (petrol and diesel) and EURO 5 PM10 factors based on a measurement scheme by TNO. \n- The entire emission time series of bus emissions has been revised, based on a new calculation method.  The improvement includes new emission factors and separate calculations for public transport and coaches. \n- New emission factors have been applied for the calculation of NH3 emissions by road traffic. This led to considerably higher emissions than reported in the past. \n- The road traffic mileages have been revised,  in particular the shares abroad in the total mileages of Dutch vehicles, and the mileages of foreign vehicles in the Netherlands. \n- The calculation of air traffic emissions has been improved (by TNO).\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe 2014 definite figures are published in March 2016. The provisional figures of 2014 are published around 1 September 2015.\n\n",
