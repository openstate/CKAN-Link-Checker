All figures are taken from other tables on StatLine, either directly or through a simple conversion. In the original tables, breakdowns by characteristics of individuals or other variables are possible. \nThe period after the year of review before data become available differs between the data series.\nThe number of exam passes/graduates in year t is the number of persons who obtained a diploma in school/study year starting in t-1 and ending in t.\n\nData available from: 2001\n\nStatus of the figures:\nMost figures are definite.\nFigures reported for the last year are provisional for:\n- causes of death;\n- perinatal mortality of pregnancy lasting at least 22 weeks (WHO);\n- diagnosis at contacts with the general practitioner;\n- diagnosis at and duration of hospitalisation;\n- individuals with supplied drugs;\n- AWBZ/Wmo-funded long term care;\n- professionally active physicians and nurses;\n- hbo nursing graduates / medicine graduates (university);\n- profitability and operating results at institutions.\nFigures reported for the last year and for the last year but one are revised provisional for:\n- expenditures on care;\n- persons employed in health and welfare.\nFigures reported for the last three years are provisional for:\n- graduates from senior vocational secondary education (mbo).\n\n\nChanges as of 16 December 2014:\nFigures have been updated for:\n- live births to teenage and older mothers;\n- causes of death\n- perinatal mortality of pregnancy lasting at least 24 weeks;\n- (healthy) life expectancy;\n- AWBZ/Wmo-funded long term care;\n- hbo nursing graduates / medicine graduates (university);\n- expenditure on care;\n- profitability and operating results at institutions.\n\n- For causes of death, methodology has been changed as of 2013, using automatic coding based on internationally used software. This results in significant changes in some of the diagnostic groups.\n- Due to a revision of National Accounts, the General Domestic Product (GDP) has been revised upwards, resulting in a decrease of care expenditures as a percentage of GDP for the years 2001-2013.\n- Figures for the number of persons employed in health and welfare have been revised for 2001 to 2010.\n- For AWBZ-funded residential long term care figures for 2011 and 2012 have been revised by using new data on use of residential care.\n- For care institutions, figures on the share of overhead have been replaced by figures on operating results per full time equivalent of employees.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew figures will be published in the second quarter of 2015. \n\n",
