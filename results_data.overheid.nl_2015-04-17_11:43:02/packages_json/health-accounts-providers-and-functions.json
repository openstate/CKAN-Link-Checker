    "notes": "\nThis table contains information on expenditure and financing in current prices on the health care used by residents in the Netherlands in one year. All activities within the area of health care are included, irrespective of whether they are performed within or outside the health care sector. These figures are based on the definition of the System of Health Accounts as used by EUROSTAT, the OECD and the WHO.\nThe figures are derived from the Dutch Health and Social Care Accounts, which cover a broader range of activities (including e.g. child day care, welfare, and social services). The Dutch Health and Social Care Accounts include exports. In this table it can be found in the function M1(HC)+ : Other goods, services + exports.\nThis table also shows how the total figure in accordance with the System of Health Accounts is calculated from the total figure of the Dutch Health and Social Care Accounts(with figures on 2007 as example):\n\nTotal figure of the Dutch Health and Social Care Accounts (74643 million euro)\n-/- health-related activities (7687 million euro)\n-/- other goods, services and exports (including welfare and children\u2019s day care) (9990 million euro)\n= Total current expenditure on health (56966 million euro) \n+/+ capital expenditure by health care providers (investments) (4581 million euro)\n= Total expenditure on health (61547 million euro)\n\n\nData available from: 2005\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for the last two years are (revised) provisional. The figures for the other years are final.\n\nChanges as of 9 December 2014:\nThe figures on 2012 and 2013 have been updated.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nDue to a revision, new figures for all years will be published at the end of May 2015. New data sources have been processed completely and consistently in the health accounts for the years 1998-2014, which makes the new time series available for the years from 1998 onwards. Also, the definitions and classifications of the System of Health Accounts 2011 have been applied.\n\n",
