    "notes": "\nThe energy accounts show how much energy flows into the Dutch economy (imports and domestic production) and how much is used by the Dutch economy (domestic use and exports). It also presents the energy that flows within the economy. The energy accounts distinguishes between energy products and users/producers of energy. They can be used to investigate where the economy gets its energy from and what it uses it for, which sector uses the most, how important imports are, and how efficiently the economy uses its energy.\n\nThe energy accounts differentiates between gross and net use of energy. Net energy is further disaggregated into different types of energy use. Gross energy use is further disaggregated into energy that is extracted from the domestic environment and energy that is imported from third parties. Imported energy is further disaggregated into different groups of energy carriers. The table presents the consumption of different energy carriers and allocates them to various industries and households. The energy accounts originate from the energy balance and are part of the environmental accounts that are published on an annual base. The data in the environmental accounts correspond directly to the economic data in the national accounts. This allows for direct comparisons of economic statistics that are derived from the Dutch national economic accounts with the energy consumption figures. Furthermore, the energy accounts can be used to construct environmental indicators. For example, the energy accounts can be used to determine the use of different energy carriers in the Netherlands as a whole and for individual industries .\n\nThe figures in the Dutch energy accounts are consistent with the concepts and definitions of the national accounts and may therefore deviate from figures in the Dutch energy balance.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are for the last year provisional. The figures for the other years are final.\nTo obtain a coherent and consistent time series, the complete time series are (re)calculated, such that the most recent information, in particular with respect to energy consumption, is included in the calculations.\n\nChanges as of september 29, 2014\nThe provisional figures for 2013 have been added.\n\nWhen are new figures published? \nNew figures will be published by November, together with the appearance of the publication 'Environmental Accounts of the Netherlands'.\n",
