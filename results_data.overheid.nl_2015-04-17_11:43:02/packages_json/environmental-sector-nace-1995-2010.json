Labour input, output and gross value added of the environmental goods and services sector are presented.\n\nOutput and gross value added are measured in basic prices and labour input is measured in full time equivalents (employed persons).\n\nThe environmental goods and services sector consists of a group of companies and authorities involved in activities with respect to measuring, preventing, limiting, minimalizing or correcting environmental damage to water, air and soil, and problems related to waste, noise and ecosystems (OECD, 1999; Eurostat 2009). \n\nThis definition includes 'cleaner technologies' and 'cleaner goods and services' which reduce environmental risk and minimize the use of natural resources and pollution. The definition of the environmental goods and services sector is determined on European level and is used by EU-countries accordingly. \nThe businesses and institutions belonging to the environmental goods and services sector can be subdivided to industries. In this table only businesses that execute environmental activities as primary or secondary activities are classified to economic industry. The ancillary activities are therefore presented separately. The activities that belong to the environmental goods and services sector can also be subdivided to environmental domains. \nThe before mentioned economic data of the environmental goods and services sector are presented in the following variables:\n-Labour input of employed persons, full time equivalents\n-Output at basic prices, mln Euro\n-Gross value added at basic prices, mln Euro\n\nData available from 1995 to 2010.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures for 2010 are revised provisional. As this table has been discontinued, they will not become definite.\n\nChanges as of 13 November  2013:\nNone, since this table has been discontinued.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNo longer applicable.\nThis table will be replaced by Environmental Goods and Services Sector; industries, economic indicators. See section 3.\n\n",
