    "notes": "\nThis table gives an overview of expenditure on regular education within the Netherlands. \n\nThe government finances schools, colleges and universities. It pays for research which is done by universities on its behalf. Furthermore it provides student grants and loans, allowances for school costs, provisions for students with a disability and child care allowances as well as subsidies to companies and non-profit organisations. The government reclaims unjustified payments for student grants and loans and allowances for school costs. It also receives interest and repayments on student loans as well as EU subsidies for education. \n\nParents and/or students have to pay tuition fees for schools, colleges and universities, parent contributions and contributions for school activities. They also have to purchase books and materials, pay for transport from home to school and back for students who are not eligible for subsidised transport, pay for private tutoring, pay interest and repayments on student loans, and repay wrongfully received student grants, loans and allowances for school costs. Parents and/or students receive child care allowances, provisions for students with a disability and an allowance for school costs as well as student grants and loans and scholarships of companies.\n\nCompanies and non-profit organisations incur costs for supervising trainees and apprentices who combine learning with work experience. They also contribute to the cost of work related education of their employees and spend money on research that is outsourced to colleges for higher professional education and universities. Furthermore they contribute to the childcare allowances given to households and provide scholarships to students. Companies receive subsidies and tax benefits for the creation of apprenticeship places and trainee placements and for providing transport for pupils.\n\nOrganisations abroad contract universities in the Netherlands to undertake research for them. The European Union provides funds and subsidies for education to schools, colleges and universities as well as to the Dutch government. Foreign governments contribute to international schools in the Netherlands that operate under their nationality.\n\nThe table also contains various indicators used nationally and internationally to compare expenditure on education and place it in a broader context. The indicators are compounded on the basis of definitions of Statistics Netherlands and/or the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). All figures presented have been calculated according to the standardised definitions of the OECD.\n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\nData recorded in the last available year are provisional figures.\n\nChanges as of 17 December 2014:\nThe provisional figures for 2013 have been added, the figures for 2012 have been adjusted from provisional to definite. Also (pre-)primary, secondary and tertiary education have been  broken down into more detail. (Pre-)primary education is broken down into pre-primary and primary education and special needs primary education. Secondary education is broken down into secondary education and senior secondary vocational and adult education. Tertiary education is broken down into higher professional education and university education.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nProvisional figures for a year are published in November of the following year.\nThese figures are provisional because some sources of data are not yet available or complete. The provisional figures are updated when more reliable sources are available. Definite figures are published exactly one year after the provisional ones.\n",
