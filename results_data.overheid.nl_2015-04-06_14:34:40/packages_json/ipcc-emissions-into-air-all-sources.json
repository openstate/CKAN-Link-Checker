It offers an insight in the emissions as reported within the framework of reporting commitments for the United Nations Climate Treaty (UNFCCC) and the European Union Monitoring Mechanism for Greenhouse gasses. \nThe emissions haven been calculated according to the IPCC-guidelines. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) takes care of the supervision of the implementation of the Kyoto-protocol.\nThe CO2 figures include the emissions caused by the use of lubricants and the indirect emissions due to the atmospheric oxidation of emitted NMVOC. These 2 sources account for 0.1 billion kilograms at the most.\n\nData available from: 1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nIn order to obtain a consistent time series the complete data set is (re)calculated when necessary, so as to be able to include the latest insights in the survey, especially in the case of emission factors.\n\n\nChanges as of 9 March 2015:\n\nAll sources:\n- Replacement of 2013 provisional figures by definite figures.\n\nStationary Sources:\n- The emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O have been revised. For several emission sources the 2006 IPCC guidelines had not been applied yet in the previous publication of this table. \n- The CH4 emissions from agriculture have been calculated with a new method. \n- There are changes in the emissions of private households, mainly due the use of new data for wood use in fireplaces.\n\nMobile sources:\n- The emissions due to the use of diesel fuel and fuel oil in inland shipping, pleasure cruising and fishery are based on revised CBS fuel sales data. \n- The CO2 emissions by road traffic include the CO2 emissions due to the use of urea in SCR catalysts in diesel fuelled vehicles. \n- For the first time the emissions by aviation (inland flights and military aircraft) due to the use of kerosene have been based on CBS fuel sales figures. \n- The N2O and CH4 emission factors for buses have been revised.\n- New data have been used on the consumption of natural gas by road traffic.\n- The consumption of biofuels in mobile machinery and railways has been taken into account.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nThe 2014 definite figures are published in March 2016. The provisional figures of 2014 are published around 1 September 2015.\n\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2015-03-11T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "bbce20ef-1973-4568-8c69-08b7ec393d44", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=70946eng"}
