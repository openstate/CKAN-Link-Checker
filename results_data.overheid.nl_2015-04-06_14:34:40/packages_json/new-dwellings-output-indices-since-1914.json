Since 1995, they are based on data from building permits of all dwellings.\n\nData available from:\nData including VAT are available from 1914 and excluding VAT from 1969. \nIn the historical series, annual figures are only available for the period 1914-1949. From 1950 onwards, quarterly figures are also available.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe historical series with base year 2000=100 was calculated for the first time in January 2010. Because the historical series 2000=100 is calculated by linking successive, independent series, it is in fact an estimate. \nPrice differences as a result of changes in realisation and quality are eliminated as much as possible within the original series. The figures remain preliminary four quarters before they become definite. \n\nChanges as of March 23rd 2015:\nThe figures of the 4th quarter and the year of 2013 are modified into definitive figures. Furthermore, the figures of the 4th quarter and the year of 2014 are added to the database. Provisional figures could be subject to change.\n\nWhen will new figures become available?\nProvisional figures for the 1st quarter of 2015 will be released in June 2015.\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2015-03-23T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "56ad1540-df35-4697-a60c-5a0c4ac12c38", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=80334eng"}
