Labour input, output and gross value added of the environmental goods and services sector are presented.\n\nOutput and gross value added are measured in basic prices and labour input is measured in full time equivalents (employed persons).\n\nThe environmental goods and services sector consists of a group of companies and authorities involved in activities with respect to measuring, preventing, limiting, minimalizing or correcting environmental damage to water, air and soil, and problems related to waste, noise and ecosystems (OECD, 1999; Eurostat 2009). \n\nThis definition includes 'cleaner technologies 'and 'cleaner goods and services' which reduce environmental risk and minimize the use of natural resources and pollution. The definition of the environmental goods and services sector is determined on European level and is used by EU-countries accordingly. \nThe group of business and institutions belonging to the environmental goods and services sector can be subdivided to industries. In this table only those business that execute environmental activities as primary or secondary activities are classified to economic industry. The ancillary activities are therefore presented separately. The activities that belong to the environmental goods and services sector can also be subdivided to environmental domains. \nThe before mentioned economic data of the environmental goods and services sector are presented in the following variables:\n-Labour input of employed persons, full time equivalents\n-Output at basic prices, mln Euro\n-Gross value added at basic prices, mln Euro\n\nData available from: 2001\n\nStatus of the figures:\nProvisional figures.\n\nChanges as of November 13, 2014:\nThis is a new table.\nIn 2014, Statistics the Netherlands has conducted a major revision on their macro-economic data. The national accounts have been compiled in accordance with the guidelines and concepts of the new European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). In addition, new statistical sources and estimation methods have been used during the revision. Simultaneously, the figures of the environmental goods and services sector have been revised. This table shows the figures after revision.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew provisional figures are published annually in November, at the same time as the publication of the Environmental Accounts of the Netherlands.\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2014-11-13T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "31b4aa31-7f06-461e-b943-ab6d5397aba2", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=82804ENG"}
