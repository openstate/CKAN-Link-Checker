The information in this table is classified according to Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (SIC 2008) and can be broken down into:\n- employee characteristics (age and sex)\n- job characteristics (type of employment contract and working hours)\n- company characteristics (size of the firm and collective wage agreements)\n\nData available from: 2009.\n\nStatus of the figures:\nThe figures in this table are definite.\n\nChanges as of 20 February 2015:\nThe new figures for 2013 are added.\n\nChanges as of 7 April 2014:\nThe figures for 2009-2011 are revised because of a change in how company size is derived. In the past the company size was derived entirely on the basis of the number of jobs per company unit. This was based on data of the Policy Record Administration. Now company size is derived mainly by linking company units with units in the Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (SIC). Company size in SIC is derived on the basis of the number of fulltime equivalents (FTE\u2019s) rather than on the number of jobs. As a result, the company size has changes in about half the jobs between 2009 and 2011. \nThe SIC Classification of the CAO sector has been changed for the year 2009. For 2009 it had been based on SIC93. As of 2010 the allocation of jobs to the SIC sector is based on the SIC 2008 classification. The new allocation for 2009 has led to an increase of 6 thousand jobs in the private sector. These jobs originate from the subsidised institutions (-4 thousand jobs) and the government (-2 thousand jobs).  \nIn the figures from 2010 onwards (after the change of method), Statistics Netherlands made a change for the number of jobs and the labour volume with \u20180\u2019 as their value. The figures of  \u2018payment per job\u2019 and \u2018working hours\u2019 were also set to \u20180\u2019. These cells included too little data. In the past these cells had been filled. \nThere has been a correction of 7 thousand jobs on the total level of revision year 2010 (after the change of methods).  Double records were accidently used when previous outcomes of Statline were compiled. \n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nNew figures for 2014 will be published in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2015-02-20T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "8d5b62ae-2f30-40bd-816c-1ec6516c5c73", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=81462ENG"}
