From the 2nd quarter 2009 on, the figures of the series 2005 = 100 are used and linked to the series 2000 = 100. \nStatistics Netherlands publishes data on the value of construction output. The volume of construction output, however, cannot be deduced from the value, which is subject to price changes. The price index on the building costs of new dwellings eliminates the effect of price changes.\nThe price index on construction output is calculated by distributing the value of the output (current prices) over the quarters essential to the price setting of the building project. Subsequently, the quarterly output is calculated in fixed prices by using the price index on the building costs of new dwellings. The index figure of the output price is the sum of the current prices divided by the sum of the fixed prices (*100).\n\nPossibilities for selection: \n- Total construction\n- Total construction of new dwellings/buildings\n- New dwellings\n- New buildings in the private sector\n- New buildings in the non-commercial sector\n- Total other buildings\n- Other dwellings\n- Other buildings in the private sector\n- Other buildings in the non-commercial sector\n\nData available from: 1st quarter 2000\nFrequency: per quarter\n\nStatus of the figures: \nThe figures are definite until the year 2013\n\nChanges as of Februari 2nd 2015\nThe price indices of the fourth quarter and the year of 2014 have been added and the figures of 2013 have become definite.\n\nWhen will new figures become available?\nProvisional figures for the first quarter of 2015 will be released in April 2015.\n\nLinking recommendation\nIf you want to compile long-term series with linked price indices on production of buildings, you can link the figures on price level 1995 with the figures on price level 2000. For that, the percentage change from the 2nd quarter 2005 with the 1st quarter 2005 must be calculated, as the price index for the 1st quarter 2005 is the last figure published on price level 1995. This change must then be adjusted to the figures for the 1st quarter 2005 of the series 1995.\nThe 2nd quarter index of the linked series is calculated by calculating the difference between the 1st quarter 2005 and the 2nd quarter 2005 according to the series on price level 2000 and multiplying this by the index for the 1st quarter 2005 according to the series on price level 1995.\n \nIn the example: (119/120) x 148=147 (rounded). For the 3rd quarter 2005 the index is calculated analogously, where because of rounding problems the first quarter figures must be used for the link.\n\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2015-02-02T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "4e0cb71a-4cbc-41f9-aeea-8240396af2f7", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=70979eng"}
