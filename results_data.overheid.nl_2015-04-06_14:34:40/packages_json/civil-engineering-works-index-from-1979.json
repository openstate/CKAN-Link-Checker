This series was created by linking independently calculated series from the past.\nAt this moment, there are eight areas within civil engineering. These areas are based on the standard Classification Products to Activity (CPA). There is also one area of which the observation has stopped. For each area a series is calculated based on the price developments of various cost components of which the product to be realised -in this case a civil engineering project- is constructed.. The price index for the total of civil engineering is a weighted average of the eight areas. The published price indices of civil engineering are based on the average price level of the month in question. Changes in the overall costs and 'profit and risks' are not taken into account. Changes in excise duties (such as that of diesel, used in civil engineering works, from 1/1/2013) are also not reflected in the price indices.\nChanges compared with twelve months previously are also published for all indices.\n\nData available from:\nThe various series of price indices of Civil Engineering cover different periods. Some start in 1979, while others start at the shift to 2000 = 100. For each series, the period for which it contains figures is given below:\n- Constructions for fluids: February 1979\n- Road construction: February 1979\n- Road maintenance: February 1979; discontinued from October 2004\n- Site preparation works: February 1979\n- Civil engineering works: January 2000\n- Bridges and tunnels: January 2000\n- Railways and underground railways: January 2000\n- Constructions for water projects: January 2000\n- Electrical installation works: January 2005\n\nStatus of the figures:\nIndex figures up to the year 2013 are definite. All other index figures are preliminary. \nThe period the price indices remain provisional depends on the moment that the collectively negotiated (CAO) wage rates for the construction industry are definite. This period can vary from 4 to about 16 months after the period under review.\n\nChanges as of February 28th 2014:\n-The CPA-codes of the series 42111 Road construction, brick paving and 42112 Road construction, asphalt paving have changed to 4211a Road construction, brick paving and 4211b Road construction, asphalt paving. \n-As of the above date the price indices are published to one decimal place. \n\nChanges as of February 27th 2015:\nThe figures of January 2015 have been added to the table.\n\nWhen will new figures be published? \nProvisional figures for April 2015 will be published at the end of May 2015.\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2015-02-27T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "d3dda51c-364c-41f6-a145-dfca1f6ffd9a", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=81139eng"}
