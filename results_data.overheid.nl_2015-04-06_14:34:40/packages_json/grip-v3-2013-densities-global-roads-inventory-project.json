The raster datasets contain the kilometers of road per 5 arcminute gridcell and are available for the total amount (all roads equal) and also per road type: highways/motorways (1), primary roads (2), secondary roads (3), tertiary roads (4) and local/urban roads (5). The current roaddensity raster are based on GRIP version 3 (2013).\nThe Global Roads Inventory Project (GRIP) database is developed by PBL. The GRIP database was created in order to provide a more recent and accurate global roads database compared to the well-known but outdated DCW/VMAP datasets. GRIP is used in PBL\u2019s global environmental assessment activities, but also by other institutes and organizations around the world. GRIP is based on data that was collected from many (50+) mainly publicly available sources, for instance National Spatial Data Infrastructures, topographic agencies, NGOs, Universities, UN agencies, etc. . Also parts of GRIP are derived from data created by the OpenStreetMap project (www.openstreetmap.org). \nTo create a consistent and transparent global roads database that can be useful for various types of analyses and also be maintained with help of a larger community the United Nations UNSDI-Transportation datamodel (\u201cv2 light\u201d) was used. This datamodel was developed by the Logistics Cluster of the UN World Food Programme. More information on UNSDI-T can be found at http://www.logcluster.org/tools/mapcentre/unsdi/unsdi-t-v2.0/\nThe ambition of GRIP is to create a dataset that is: globally consistent (in terms of the underlying data model and attribute coding);spatially accurate (~50-100m positional accuracy); topologically integrated; suitable for mapping at an approximate scale of 1:100,000 - 1:1000,000; focused on roads between settlements (not streets); up-to-date and with the possibility of frequent updates; preferably well documented; publicly available (on an \"attribution only\" basis)\n\nGRIP is not perfect and continues to be \u201cwork in progress\u201d. In GRIP version 1 (2009) more recent and accurate data was combined for almost 200 countries. There is still a (decreasing) number of countries in GRIP that is only covered by VMAP data. Improved and newly available datasets are incorporated on an occasional basis.", "license_title": "Publiek Domein", "modified": "2015-04-06", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/deed.nl", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Nationaal Georegister", "created": "2015-03-26T12:56:19.147623", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:56:19.121612", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115619.119226ngr.png", "revision_id": "918c4dfd-7496-4ac4-8b0d-a95fe2682aa9", "type": "organization", "id": "a9a8e392-9f69-493e-8b44-4a1586725a66", "name": "nationaal-georegister"}, "revision_id": "6c2df629-7770-4780-99ca-bd5816be08f9", "landingpage": ""}
