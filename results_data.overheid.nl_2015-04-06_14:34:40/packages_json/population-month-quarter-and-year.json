Definite figures will be added to the table on an annual basis;\n- Marriages will include registered partnerships; \n- Data on registered partnerships will be discontinued;\n- Married persons will include persons who have signed partnership contracts. An extra preceding marital status (married) has been added; \n- Marriage dissolutions will be presented including registered partnership dissolutions;\n- Divorced persons will be presented including legally terminated partnerships;\n- Data on persons who have moved house within the Netherlands will no longer be broken down by place in the household. \n\nData available from: 1995\n\nStatus of the figures:\n- All figures on Asylum requests are final.\n- All figures of 1995 up to and including 2013 are final.\n- Figures for the 1th of January 2014 are final, the other figures on the population of 2014 and 2015 are provisional.\n- The updating of asylum applications in this table is discontinued with effect from 2012.\n\nChanges effective from 27 March 2015:\nIncluded are provisional figures for February 2015.\n\nChanges effective from 2 December 2014: \nThe 2012 year figures for male and female life expectancy at birth have been corrected. As a result of an error, the 2011 figures were also used for 2012. These corrections have no effects on other figures in the table.\n\nWhen will new figures be published?\nAt the end of each month provisional figures of the most important subjects of the previous month will be added in this publication. Data for previous months may be subject to adjustment.\n", "license_title": "CC-BY 3.0", "modified": "2015-03-27T06:00:00", "url": null, "license_url": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nl/legalcode", "organization": {"description": "", "title": "Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek", "created": "2015-03-26T12:55:58.497408", "approval_status": "approved", "revision_timestamp": "2015-03-26T11:55:58.470550", "is_organization": true, "state": "active", "image_url": "20150326-115558.468124cbslogonl.gif", "revision_id": "9d6a567a-44b5-482a-a9dd-d6d81a243617", "type": "organization", "id": "9b5de831-ed9e-4949-9489-b06934456537", "name": "centraal-bureau-voor-de-statistiek"}, "revision_id": "0b53c633-705c-46d2-a8ac-973023fb4af9", "landingpage": "http://opendata.cbs.nl/dataportaal/portal.html#tableId=37943eng"}
