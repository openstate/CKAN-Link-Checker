    "notes": "\nThis table contains figures on the emissions in the Netherlands by mobile sources. These are actual emissions in or above the Netherlands and on the continental shelf (see paragraph 2). It also contains the emission factors derived from these emissions (in grams of emission per kilogram of consumed fuel).\nMobile source emissions are caused by the combustion of motor fuels, the evaporation of fuel and load residues (VOC), wear of tyres, brake linings and road surfaces (PM10), and the wear of railway overhead contact lines, including emissions caused by friction and spark erosion of the current collectors.\nThe emissions are calculated by multiplying data on activities, for instance vehicle kilometres and fuel consumption, by emission factors.\n\nData available from: 1990\n\nStatus of the figures:\nIn order to obtain a consistent time series the complete data set is (re)calculated when necessary, so as to be able to include the latest insights in the survey, especially in the case of emission factors.\n\nChanges as of 9 March 2015:\n- Replacement of 2013 provisional figures by definite figures. \n- The motorcycle and moped emissions of 1990-2012 have been recalculated with improved emission factors. Based on a new  survey, mopeds of recent model years  in particular appear to be more polluting than assumed at first. \n- There has been an update of emission factors for road traffic. This particularly concerns CNG vehicles, EURO 4, 5 and 6 diesel cars, EURO 5 plug-in hybrids (petrol and diesel) and EURO 5 PM10 factors based on a measurement scheme by TNO. \n- The entire emission time series of bus emissions has been revised, based on a new calculation method. The improvement includes new emission factors and separate calculations for public transport and coaches. \n- The road traffic mileages have been revised,  in particular the shares abroad in the total mileages of Dutch vehicles, and the mileages of foreign vehicles in the Netherlands. \n- The calculation of air traffic emissions has been improved (by TNO). \n- LNG driven vessels (natural gas) have been introduced in the emission calculations of seagoing shipping.\n\nWhen will new figures be published? \nThe 2014 definite figures are published in March 2016. The provisional figures of 2014 are published around 1 September 2015.\n\n",
